# RL78/L13-OB1203 #

This project configures the RL78/L13 to communicate with the OB1203 sensor.
RL78/L13 reads sensor values and calculates Heart Rate and SPO2 values.
Calculated values are displayed on the Native LCD screen.

# System Requirements #
- [IAR Embedded Workbench for RL78 v4.10.1](https://www.iar.com/iar-embedded-workbench/#!?architecture=RL78)
- Applilet 4 for RL78 Microcontrollers AP4 1.10.02.06 distributed with IAR Embedded Workbench for RL78 v4.10.1

## Development Hardware Platform ##
- Renesas Starter Kit for RL78/L13 [YR0K5010WMS000BE](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/software-tools/boards-and-kits/starter-kits/renesas-starter-kit-for-rl78-l13.html)
- OB1203 breakout board
- (Optional) USB-to-Serial High-Speed Adapter [Keyspan](https://assets.tripplite.com/product-pdfs/en/usa19hs.pdf)

## OB1203 to RL78/L13 connection scheme ##

This project requires 3.3 volts DC power supply to the OB1203. The Renesas Starter Kit for RL78/L13 must therefore be configured to supply this voltage by setting
(J5:= Pin2-3 shorted; J6:= All open). See R20UT2124EG0100 sheet 3 of 8.

3.3V can be acquired by connecting to J7 or regulating JA1-1 (5VDC) to 3.3V


| OB1203	| RSKRL78L13
|-----------|----------------------------
| GND		| JA1-2 
| NC		| NC
| NC		| NC
| INTB		| JA5-9
| SDA		| JA1-25
| SCL		| JA1-26
| VLED		| 3V3  (J7) 
| VDD		| 3V3  (J7)

## Acquiring additional information ##
Data from the OB1203 can be acquired directly by setting the preprocessor `DEBUG_LVL` in `r_cg_userdefine.h` to LOG_DEBUG_RAW.
There are other levels of details which may be acquired from the OB1203. 

It must be noted that, although the DMAC is used, the serial printing function blocks program control (in write.c) until all data is printed to the terminal. This is primarily to maintain proper sequence of data.

## Evaluation Platform ##
- Optimized H/W design to be released
