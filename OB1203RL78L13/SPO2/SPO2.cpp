/*This algorithm was developed by Dan Allen, IDT-Renesas 2019.
The main program fetches data from OB1203 at 100Hz for both red and IR.
It arranges the bytes from the FIFO and calls add_sample(). Add sample keeps a 
running average of 4 samples (12Hz) and loads the filtered data
into dc_buffer. The DC buffer is long enough for two samples at the slowest heart
rate of ~40Hz, plus an extra sample to make the sum of squares easy and also an
even number of samples to be used as the maximum moving average filter for the heart rate samples.
Main calls get_sum_squares() one, which calculates some constants for algorithm.
It only needs to be run once.
Once each second main calls do_algorithm_part1(). This checks to make sure enough 
samples have been acquired then calls get rms(). 
get_rms() calls get_DC() which calculates the mean levels of IR and red over the entire buffer. 
Note any variable with a 1f ( "one eff" not "LF" - font can be confusing) means it has an 
additional 4 bits of fixed precision, set by FIXED_BITS, so mean1f is 16 times the mean. 
Then get_rms() calls copy_data() which does for each channel:
-subtracts the means
-store the AC residuals with fixed precision of 4 bits in AC1f[]
-calculate the slope: slope1f
-remove the slope: slope1f
-calculate the variance var1f
-calculate the RMS rms1f
This is about half the computational burden of the program.
The main program takes a break to collect more samples then calls do_algorithm_part2().
Part 2 calls calc_R() to get the R value (Red_AC/Red_mean) / (IR_AC/IR_mean). 
This has a floating point operation.
Then it calls calc_spo2() which has more floating point operations. 
This is really slow on the 16bit processor (~several ms). 
The spo2 calculation uses a polynomial in R to caculate the Spo2 level. 
It only uses half the buffer: one "sample_length" of 1.5 seconds. 
If you use a longer value you pick up error due to curvature and that leads 
to a low SpO2 level, since similar curvature increases the RMS more for the smaller red AC signal. 
Higher R is lower SpO2. Also any noise or motion increases R. So SpO2 isn't 
returned by do_algorith_part2() if a valid heart rate isn't obtained (returns 0).
Once the Spo2 is done we have the IR values stored in AC1f. 
We use those for the heart rate calculation in do_algorithm_part2(). 
The following steps are performed.
-filter the data a lot. This is necessary to flatten out the dichrotic notch 
which otherwise leads to false peaks (erroniously high heart rate). 
By default the maximum filter length is applied. If a previous valid heart 
rate average is availble it will use less filtering for faster heart rates. 
-run find_max_corr() to find the first maximum of the autocorrelation. 
This is a robust way to align to find the period of a signal with huge amounts 
of noise as every sample is included in every point in the autocorrelation function, 
so it is very smooth, especially compared to differentiating and peak finding 
using zero crossings of the derivative.
-calculate the heart rate from the correlation peak X using 
60 sec/min * 100 samples/sec / X samples per period = BPM. This is retained in fixed point precision.
-run a Kalman filter to look throw out outliers in both SpO2 and HR.
-update the filter length (samples2avg).
For all peak estimattions fast quadratic fits are used to obtain resolution higher
than the sample rate.

  was split in half to allow a non-RTOS machine to take a break to collect samples
  from the OB1203 buffer. SpO2 is calculated with the R values REDrms/REDmean / IRrms/IRmean.
  Heart rate is calculated by finding the first peak of the autocorrelation using
  variable stepping to find the minimum and then doing fine search at twice the minimum.
  Heart rate-dependent filtering is applied to the AC IR data.
  The stepping in the search algorithm is small for small offsets and large for
  large offsets to keep accuracy proportional and minimize the number of steps.
  The correlations is sample_length multply+add operations, so it takes time.
  Time limits have been applied to time_out in time to get samples from the buffer.
  A key feature is the Kalman filter which throws out outliers by comparing the recent sample
  standard deviation to the next sample. Samples twice the stdev are tossed and not
  included in the kalman running average estimation, but are included in the variance 
  calculation. If too many algorithm fails or outliers are incurred the Kalman resets.*/
